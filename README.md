# hello-world
Hi everyone!

My name is Martha Nu√±ez Ceh, I'm from Queretaro, Mexico, but right now I'm living in Jalisco. I love green-grass color things, anime, k-pop, doramas (korean tv novels), books (I don't have a favorite genre), to date my friends and my family (cat included).
I hate lies, and cockroaches; I do really hate them.
